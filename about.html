            <h2 class="section-title">Meet Adam</h2>
            <p>
              Adam grew up in The Woodlands, Texas, the son of a Palestinian immigrant. He served 12 years overseas in Europe and Asia.
              After meeting his wife in Tacoma, Washington became home. They are raising two boys in District 10 who attend public schools,
              where his wife volunteers with the PTA.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the military, Adam kept serving through county work that improves everyday life. He put himself through college,
              earning a bachelor’s and a master’s degree while working full time. That same work ethic guides this campaign:
              do the work, put people first, deliver results.

        <h2 class="section-title">Experience and Service</h2>
        <p>
          As a veteran and project manager, Adam knows leadership, accountability, and teamwork matter. Living in Europe and Asia showed him what is possible
          when a society guarantees healthcare, invests in education, and keeps food affordable and healthy. Here at home he has partnered with nonprofits and labor
          to support good-paying jobs and safe workplaces.

      <!-- Why it matters -->
      <section id="why-it-matters" class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="section-title">Why it matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fairness and justice for every person</li>
          <li>Investing in our kids and our public schools</li>
          <li>Affordable, accessible healthcare for every family</li>
          <li>Protecting our environment for the next generation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Our country is at a crossroads. Our kids deserve a future, not a system stuck in place. Change starts with leaders rooted in our communities,
          not in donor lists. We need people with integrity who will stand up to special interests and deliver for working families.
