    <section id="healthcare">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/healthcare.jpg" alt="Healthcare Rally" />
      <h2>Healthcare</h2>
      <p>Healthcare should be a basic human right. The United States is the only country among the 38-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that does not offer universal healthcare, despite being the wealthiest. I support a public, single-payer system like Medicare for All so families don’t have to choose between care and bankruptcy.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="housing">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/housing.jpg" alt="Affordable Housing" />
      <h2>Housing</h2>
      <p>One way the federal government can help is by offering first-time homebuyers a special low-interest mortgage program. We also need rent relief and to tax real estate speculation that drives up costs for working families.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="taxation">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/taxation.jpg" alt="Fair Taxation Protest" />
      <h2>Fair Taxation</h2>
      <p>I support closing loopholes and taxing the ultra-wealthy fairly. We need a system where Amazon doesn’t pay zero in taxes while everyday Americans struggle. When big corporations pay their fair share, we all benefit.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cost">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/groceries.jpg" alt="Grocery Prices" />
      <h2>Lower Cost of Living</h2>
      <p>Groceries, gas, and rent have all gone up. I support smart subsidies to American farmers, energy independence, and strong labor protections to help reduce prices and keep families stable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="repro">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/abortion.jpg" alt="Reproductive Freedom March" />
      <h2>Reproductive Freedom</h2>
      <p>I support the right to choose. Government should never interfere in personal medical decisions. We need to protect access to abortion care, contraception, and comprehensive reproductive health services for all.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="climate">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/climate.jpg" alt="Climate Action Protest" />
      <h2>Climate Action</h2>
      <p>Climate change is the biggest threat to our future. I support ending fossil fuel subsidies and investing in clean energy infrastructure, green jobs, and transit systems that reduce emissions while creating opportunity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="workers">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/workers.jpg" alt="Workers Rights" />
      <h2>Workers First</h2>
      <p>I support strong unions, fair wages, paid family leave, and protections for gig and service workers. We need to restore the balance of power to working people, not corporate boards.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gov">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/transparency.jpg" alt="Transparent Government" />
      <h2>Transparent Government</h2>
      <p>No more backroom deals. I support banning corporate PACs and special interest money, and instead pushing for a public campaign financing system, like Seattle’s Democracy Voucher Program, to level the playing field.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="democracy">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/vote.jpg" alt="Voting Access" />
      <h2>Strengthen Democracy</h2>
      <p>I support expanding voting rights, passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, securing elections, and ending gerrymandering so every vote counts and every voice is heard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="veterans">
      <div class="divider-section"></div>
      <img src="img/veterans.jpg" alt="Veterans and Families" />
      <h2>Veterans & Military Families</h2>
      <p>As a 20-year Army veteran, I know the sacrifices made by military families. I support improving VA healthcare, housing support, mental health access, and transition services that honor our commitments to those who served.</p>
