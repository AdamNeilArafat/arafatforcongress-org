            <h2 class="h4 section-title">Lowering the cost of living</h2>
            <p>Housing, groceries, childcare, and energy costs are squeezing families. Relief has to be real and lasting.</p>
            <h3 class="h6 text-muted">What I support at the federal level</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Groceries.</strong> I would support enforcing antitrust laws against dominant processors and retailers, more price transparency in supply chains, and targeted farm supports that stabilize prices while protecting small and mid-size farmers. Smart subsidies keep shelves stocked and prices fair for families.</li>
              <li><strong>First homes.</strong> I would support a federally backed first-time buyer mortgage option with a target rate around 3 percent for income-eligible families, capped by local home-price limits so it helps buyers, not speculation.</li>
              <li><strong>Update the rules to match reality.</strong> I would support modernizing federal poverty guidelines so eligibility reflects today’s costs. I would support indexing key benefits and tax credits to regional cost differences so San Francisco is not treated like Kansas. Help should arrive where costs are highest instead of relying on static cutoff numbers.</li>
              <li><strong>Lower monthly bills.</strong> I would support bigger rebates for weatherization, heat pumps, and community solar to cut electric and heating costs.</li>

            <h2 class="h4 section-title">Universal healthcare</h2>
            <p>Healthcare should be a basic human right. The United States is the only one of the 38 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) without universal coverage, even though we are the wealthiest of the 38.</p>
            <h3 class="h6 text-muted">What I support at the federal level</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Universal coverage for all.</strong> I would support automatic enrollment with a guaranteed benefits floor so everyone is covered.</li>
              <li><strong>Reproductive freedom.</strong> I would support protecting access to reproductive healthcare. Medical decisions belong to patients and their doctors.</li>
              <li><strong>Prescription drugs.</strong> I would support direct price negotiation, an end to patent gaming, and firm caps on out-of-pocket costs for essential medicines.</li>
              <li><strong>Mental health parity.</strong> I would support real parity in networks, access, and reimbursement so mental and behavioral health care is actually available.</li>
              <li><strong>Primary care first.</strong> I would support investments in clinics and providers in underserved areas so people get care early and locally.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>I would support a strong corporate minimum tax on book profits.</li>
              <li>I would support anti-offshoring rules that end profit shifting and shell games.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Short.</strong> Ban corporate and lobbyist money. Democracy vouchers for voters. Real-time disclosure.</li>
              <li>I would not take corporate PAC money.</li>
              <li>I would support a ban on corporate PACs and registered lobbyists donating to federal candidates or coordinating with campaigns.</li>
              <li>I would support a ban on lobbyist fundraising and bundling.</li>
              <li>I would support a simple public-financing system where each voter receives a small democracy voucher that can be given to a candidate. Campaigns can use vouchers plus small individual donations only. Seattle’s Democracy Voucher program shows how this can work in practice.</li>
              <li>I would support near real-time reporting for every campaign dollar with strong penalties for violations.</li>

            <h3 class="h6 text-muted">Corporate Social Responsibility Tax</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> a federal surtax applied when corporations push costs onto the public or act in bad faith.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Triggers.</strong> Extreme CEO-to-median-worker pay gaps, chronic low wages, repeated safety violations, mass layoffs during record profits, environmental damage.</li>
              <li><strong>How it works.</strong> The surtax rises with harm. Firms can reduce it by raising wages, narrowing pay gaps, investing in safety, and remedying damage.</li>
              <li><strong>Why it helps.</strong> It rewards companies that do right by workers and communities and makes it costly to treat people and places as expendable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="h6 text-muted">What I support at the federal level</h3>
            <ul>
