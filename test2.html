  <h2>Quick read</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Goal: use House power to block or unwind bad policy with or without Senate support.</li>
    <li>Method: combine oversight, spending controls, fast‑track laws, and time‑boxed floor tactics.</li>
    <li>Backstops: automatic triggers and metrics that force action and keep faith with voters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Speaker of the House quick toolkit</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Control recognition and floor schedule</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What it is: the Speaker decides who is recognized to speak and when items come up.</li>
        <li>Use it to: prioritize oversight, resolutions, and spending riders that limit bad policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> put a privileged resolution or a spending limitation on the floor before other business when an agency defies the law.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Rules Committee leverage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What it is: shape special rules to allow or block amendments that tighten accountability.</li>
        <li>Use it to: make Holman amendments and policy riders in order on appropriations bills.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Questions of privilege</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What it is: privileged resolutions on the rights of the House or its investigations.</li>
        <li>Use it to: bring contempt or enforcement measures straight to the floor.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="quiet note">These tools rest on House rules and precedents that give the Chair broad recognition and agenda control.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Core tools for this scenario</h2>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>1) Appropriations riders and limits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: add “no funds may be used for X” or “funds available only if Y” language to stop a policy.</li>
      <li>Why it works: the Antideficiency Act and the power of the purse make unlawful spending risky for officials.</li>
      <li>Feasibility: high in the House. Senate may resist, so attach riders to must‑pass bills or slice into focused bills.</li>
      <li>Accountability hooks: require monthly public certifications to release funds and referrals to the Government Accountability Office if missing.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> “None of the funds for Program Z may be used unless the agency posts the legal basis and cost estimate, and the Comptroller General confirms receipt.”</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>2) Holman Rule targeted cuts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: allow amendments in appropriations that cut a specific program or reduce a specific salary.</li>
      <li>Use it to: surgically defund an office that is the engine of a harmful policy.</li>
      <li>Guardrails: avoid personal punishment intent. Aim at duties and funding, not a named person for retribution.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> reduce the salary for an office that ignores statutory deadlines to one dollar until compliance is certified.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>3) Congressional Review Act (CRA)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: fast‑track joint resolution to nullify an agency rule. Limits Senate filibuster.</li>
      <li>Use it when: the executive issues a rule or guidance that exceeds the law or harms the public.</li>
      <li>Extra: use the “lookback” window to reach late‑issued rules from the end of the prior Congress.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> file multiple CRA disapprovals on bundled rules and force Senate votes with simple majority threshold.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>4) Resolutions of inquiry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: a simple House resolution demanding specific facts from the President or a Cabinet Secretary, with a 14 legislative day clock in committee.</li>
      <li>Use it to: get documents quickly when agencies stall normal oversight requests.</li>
      <li>If ignored: escalate to contempt or spending holds.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> demand all legal memoranda and cost models used to justify a policy change within 14 legislative days.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>5) Impoundment Control Act and Antideficiency Act enforcement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: laws that require the executive to spend money as Congress directed and prohibit spending without authority.</li>
      <li>Use it to: challenge slow‑walking, withholding, or repurposing funds for policy reasons.</li>
      <li>Flow: letter to Office of Management and Budget and agency → Government Accountability Office legal decision → riders and contempt if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> when the executive withholds obligated funds for policy reasons, request a Government Accountability Office ruling and freeze the responsible account by rider until compliance.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>6) War Powers Resolution and National Emergencies Act checks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: fast‑track procedures to force votes to authorize or end hostilities and terminate national emergencies.</li>
      <li>Use it to: unwind emergency‑based policy or unauthorized military action even with Senate resistance.</li>
      <li>Pair with: funding riders that bar spending under an emergency after a set date unless Congress votes to continue.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> file a joint resolution to end an emergency that drives a regulation, while placing a date‑certain cutoff in appropriations unless Congress affirmatively extends the emergency.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>7) Contempt and enforcement options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: inherent contempt by the House, criminal contempt referrals, and civil enforcement suits to compel compliance with subpoenas.</li>
      <li>Use it when: agencies refuse to testify or turn over documents and the public interest requires speed.</li>
      <li>Modernization option: House rule to impose daily monetary penalties on non‑compliant officials until production, with due process.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> adopt a privileged resolution directing the Sergeant at Arms to serve notice of fines that automatically accrue every day the subpoena remains unmet.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>8) Calendar Wednesday rescue</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is: a seldom used rule that lets a committee call up a reported bill on a Wednesday when leadership is blocking it.</li>
      <li>Use it to: force floor time for a narrowly crafted oversight or accountability bill.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> call up a targeted bill requiring public posting of apportionment schedules when the Rules Committee declines a rule.</div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Automatic triggers that do not need a new vote</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Self‑executing riders:</strong> “Funds for Account A are unavailable after 30 days unless the agency publishes required data and notifies the Comptroller General.”</li>
    <li><strong>Certification gates:</strong> “No travel funds for Office B until the Inspector General certifies policy compliance.” Security exceptions are permitted by law and must be listed publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>Statutory fast clocks:</strong> if a rule is issued, a Congressional Review Act clock starts and forces a privilege window without needing leadership consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic referral to Government Accountability Office:</strong> any missed reporting deadline automatically triggers a public legal inquiry by the Comptroller General, with results sent to the House.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example"><strong>Collusion scenario:</strong> if the executive and a federal court stonewall, the House can pair inherent contempt with spending gates that halt the specific policy engine. Add a mandatory floor vote on a narrow, time‑limited cut to keep unity and make the pressure public.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Measurements and bright‑line tests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Debt and deficit guardrail:</strong> no net increase to the on‑budget deficit in the 5‑year and 10‑year Congressional Budget Office windows, unless offset within three fiscal years in the same bill.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax fairness test:</strong> a tax bill fails if the average effective federal tax rate paid by the top ten percent falls below the rate paid by the middle quintile, using official distribution tables.</li>
    <li><strong>Benefit share test:</strong> at least 60 percent of net benefits must go to the bottom 60 percent of households for any refundable credit expansion.</li>
    <li><strong>No public funds for recreation:</strong> no appropriated funds for recreational fees or dues for senior officials. Security and official protection remain funded and reported separately. Require monthly disclosure of any official travel that includes recreational activities.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Pass or fail mapping inside the Evergreen Pact</h2>
  <p class="note">This toolkit plugs into the Pact’s map so every action has a next step if it passes or fails.</p>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Pass → follow‑through</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Appropriations rider passes → post compliance dashboard within 7 days → schedule oversight hearing in 30 days → renew rider if needed.</li>
        <li>CRA passes one chamber but not the other → pivot to rider plus litigation referrals and public reporting.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Fail → escalate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rider fails in Senate → split into narrower accounts and attach to must‑pass, then use Calendar Wednesday to move a transparency bill.</li>
        <li>Subpoena ignored → inherent contempt notice and fines → pair with account freeze in next continuing resolution.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Risks and how to manage them</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="warn">Bill of attainder risk:</span> avoid naming individuals for punishment purpose. Target duties and funding, not a person.</li>
    <li><span class="warn">Separation of powers:</span> spending limits are strong, but do not block core security protection. Use narrow, tailored text.</li>
    <li><span class="ok">Durability:</span> pair quick riders with permanent transparency or oversight statutes to lock in gains.</li>
  </ul>
