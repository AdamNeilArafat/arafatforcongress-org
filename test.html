    <h2>Quick read</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with spending controls, fast review votes, and public oversight.</li>
      <li>Backstop with automatic triggers that do not need a second vote later.</li>
      <li>Track results with clear measurements, not vibes.</li>

    <h2>Speaker of the House quick toolkit</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="tool">
        <h3>Floor recognition and schedule</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What it is: the Speaker controls who is recognized and when items come up.</li>
          <li>Use it to: put accountability items first, hold slow‑walkers last.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> schedule a vote on a funding limit before any other business when an agency ignores a document request.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="tool">
        <h3>Rules Committee planning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What it is: a special rule can allow or block amendments.</li>
          <li>Use it to: make accountability amendments in order and block poison pills.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> the rule for a spending bill allows a “no funds may be used” amendment that targets one harmful policy.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="tool">
        <h3>Questions of privilege</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What it is: a privileged resolution on House rights or investigations.</li>
          <li>Use it to: bring contempt or production demands straight to the floor.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> a resolution that orders the production of records and sets a deadline, with penalties if missed.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Core tools for this scenario</h2>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>1) Appropriations riders and limits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: add text in a funding bill that blocks money for a bad policy.</li>
        <li>Why it bites: if money is blocked, the policy stalls in place.</li>
        <li>How to aim it: name the activity, office, or account, and say what must be published to unlock funds.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> “No funds may be used to enforce Policy A until the legal memo and cost model are posted for public review.”</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>2) Holman Rule targeted cuts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: reduce or zero out a program or a salary inside a funding bill.</li>
        <li>When to use: when one office is the engine for the harm.</li>
        <li>Guardrail: target duties and dollars, not a person for punishment.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> “Reduce the salary for the non‑compliance officer to one dollar until Policy A is withdrawn.”</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>3) Congressional Review Act (CRA)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: a fast joint vote to cancel a rule. Senate debate is limited.</li>
        <li>Even if it fails: the vote defines the issue and sets up a later reversal.</li>
        <li>Side move: the “lookback” window can reach late‑term rules issued at the end of a Congress.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> file CRA resolutions for three related rules at once and demand separate up or down votes.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>4) Resolutions of inquiry</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: a simple House resolution that demands facts from an agency on a fast clock.</li>
        <li>When to use: when normal letters are ignored or delayed.</li>
        <li>Next step: if the deadline is missed, move to fines or to a funding freeze.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> require delivery of all models and emails used to create a rule within 14 legislative days.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>5) Spending law enforcement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: the executive must spend money as directed and must not spend without authority.</li>
        <li>When to use: if funds are withheld for policy reasons or rerouted.</li>
        <li>Flow: demand records → request a legal review → block funds until fixed.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> freeze an office budget in the next bill until the missing spending plan is delivered.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>6) War Powers and emergency checks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: force votes to end an unauthorized action or an emergency that drives a policy.</li>
        <li>Pair with: a funding cutoff date unless Congress votes to continue.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> file a resolution to end an emergency and include a date certain that blocks spending tied to that emergency after 30 days.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>7) Contempt and compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: if an agency refuses to comply, use fines, court action, or other penalties to compel action.</li>
        <li>House option: adopt a rule that imposes daily monetary penalties on officials who defy subpoenas after due process.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> a privileged resolution that starts daily fines until documents are produced, while a funding rider blocks travel for the office that is in defiance.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>8) Calendar Wednesday rescue</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain talk: a rarely used path that lets a committee call up a reported bill on a Wednesday when leadership blocks it.</li>
        <li>Use it for: narrow transparency or compliance bills that deserve daylight.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> bring up a short bill that requires public posting of spending plans within seven days.</div>
    </div>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Automatic triggers that do not need a new vote</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self‑executing gates:</strong> funds stay locked unless the agency posts required data and notifies the House clerk.</li>
      <li><strong>Certification switches:</strong> no travel or training funds for an office until the Inspector General certifies compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Clock starts now:</strong> a rule submission starts a fast review window without leadership permission.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto referral:</strong> missed deadlines trigger a public legal review and a report to the House.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example"><strong>Collusion scenario:</strong> if agencies, lawyers, and a court all slow roll, pair a fines rule with a small but visible account freeze. Public dashboards show the missed steps and the money path that is blocked.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Measurements and bright‑line tests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deficit guardrail:</strong> no increase to the on‑budget deficit in the five year and ten year windows under official scoring, unless fully offset within three fiscal years in the same bill.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax fairness test:</strong> the average effective federal tax rate for the top ten percent must not fall below the rate for the middle quintile in official tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit share test:</strong> at least sixty percent of net benefits must go to the bottom sixty percent of households.</li>
      <li><strong>No recreation spending by officials:</strong> no public funds for club dues, greens fees, or similar recreation for senior officials. Security and protection are funded and reported separately.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency timers:</strong> documents due in fourteen legislative days. Missed deadlines escalate to fines and a small account freeze in the next funding bill.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pass or fail mapping inside the Evergreen Pact</h2>
    <p class="note">Every step leads somewhere. If a vote passes, follow through. If it fails, escalate.</p>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="tool">
        <h3>Pass path</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rider passes → post a public tracker within seven days and hold an oversight check at day thirty.</li>
          <li>CRA passes one chamber → publish the vote record, turn to enforcement riders, and support court review with public records.</li>
          <li>Documents delivered → close the loop with a short memo and remove the gate next cycle.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="tool">
        <h3>Fail path</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rider blocked in the Senate → split it into narrower accounts and attach to the next must‑pass item.</li>
          <li>Subpoena ignored → begin daily fines after due process and freeze a travel or training account in the next bill.</li>
          <li>Emergency vote fails → time‑limit the spending tied to that emergency and force a second vote on a short fuse.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tool">
      <h3>Pact map block you can reuse</h3>

    <h2>Risks and guardrails</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="warn">Precision matters:</span> name the activity and the account. Avoid broad language that sweeps up unrelated work.</li>
      <li><span class="warn">No personal punishment:</span> target duties and dollars. Do not draft to punish a person.</li>
      <li><span class="ok">Durability:</span> pair fast riders with a short transparency law so the public can track compliance next year.</li>
