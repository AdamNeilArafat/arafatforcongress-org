<h3>7) Contempt and compliance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plain talk: if an agency refuses to comply, use fines, court action, or other penalties to compel action.</li>
<li>House option: adopt a rule that imposes daily monetary penalties on officials who defy subpoenas after due process.</li>
</ul>
<div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> a privileged resolution that starts daily fines until documents are produced, while a funding rider blocks travel for the office that is in defiance.</div>

<h3>8) Calendar Wednesday rescue</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plain talk: a rarely used path that lets a committee call up a reported bill on a Wednesday when leadership blocks it.</li>
<li>Use it for: narrow transparency or compliance bills that deserve daylight.</li>
</ul>
<div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> bring up a short bill that requires public posting of spending plans within seven days.</div>

<h2>Automatic triggers that do not need a new vote</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self executing gates:</strong> funds stay locked unless the agency posts required data and notifies the House clerk.</li>
<li><strong>Certification switches:</strong> no travel or training funds for an office until the Inspector General certifies compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Clock starts now:</strong> a rule submission starts a fast review window without leadership permission.</li>
<li><strong>Auto referral:</strong> missed deadlines trigger a public legal review and a report to the House.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Measurements and bright line tests</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deficit guardrail:</strong> no increase to the on budget deficit in the five year and ten year windows under official scoring, unless fully offset within three fiscal years in the same bill.</li>
<li><strong>Tax fairness test:</strong> the average effective federal tax rate for the top ten percent must not fall below the rate for the middle quintile in official tables.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit share test:</strong> at least sixty percent of net benefits must go to the bottom sixty percent of households.</li>
<li><strong>No recreation spending by officials:</strong> no public funds for club dues, greens fees, or similar recreation for senior officials. Security and protection are funded and reported separately.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency timers:</strong> documents due in fourteen legislative days. Missed deadlines escalate to fines and a small account freeze in the next funding bill.</li>

<h2>Pass or fail mapping inside the Evergreen Pact</h2>
<div class="grid">
<div class="tool">
<h3>Pass path</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rider passes, post a public tracker within seven days, hold an oversight check at day thirty.</li>
<li>CRA passes one chamber, publish the vote record, turn to enforcement riders, support court review with public records.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tool">
<h3>Fail path</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rider blocked in the Senate, split it into narrower accounts and attach to the next must pass item.</li>
<li>Subpoena ignored, begin daily fines after due process and freeze a travel or training account in the next bill.</li>
<li>Emergency vote fails, time limit the spending tied to that emergency and force a second vote on a short fuse.</li>
</ul>
