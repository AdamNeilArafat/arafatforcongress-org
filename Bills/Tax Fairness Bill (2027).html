Short Title
“This
Bill
may be cited as the
Social Security Solvency Bill (2027)
.”
Section 2. Findings
Social Security is an earned benefit that seniors and people with disabilities rely on after a lifetime of work.
Explanation:
Workers pay in over decades with the promise of retirement security and protection for survivors and people with disabilities.
Solvency can be secured without raising taxes on households under $400,000 or cutting benefits.
Explanation:
Targeted high‑income contributions and compliance improvements can close the gap while protecting working families.
Transparent, automatic guardrails keep this
Bill
budget‑neutral across standard scoring windows.
Explanation:
If forecasts change, pre‑set adjustments maintain fiscal balance.
Section 2A. Fiscal Guardrail: No Net Increase (5‑ and 10‑Year Windows)
To preserve program solvency without adding to the unified federal deficit, the following fiscal guardrail applies and shall control in any conflict.
Rule Text.
(1) No Net Increase. As scored by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation at enactment and annually thereafter, this Act shall not produce a net increase in the unified federal deficit across both the 5‑year and 10‑year budget windows.

(2) Automatic Offsets. If a shortfall is identified in any scoring update, automatic offsets shall take effect beginning the next fiscal year to restore deficit neutrality within 3 fiscal years, prioritized to:
    (A) apply a high‑income Social Security payroll surtax on wages above a designated threshold,
    (B) extend the net investment income tax (or equivalent) to high‑income pass‑through income for Trust Fund stabilization, and
    (C) phase‑in an additional Social Security contribution on earnings above a secondary cap, without changing benefits or rates for households under $400,000.

(3) Protection for Middle‑Class Households. Nothing in this Guardrail shall raise statutory tax rates or net liability for households with adjusted gross income under $400,000.

(4) Transparency. CBO shall publish an annual guardrail memorandum summarizing the 5‑year and 10‑year deficit impact of this Act and whether the guardrail is satisfied. The Social Security Trustees shall include a concordance note in the next Trustees’ Report.

(5) Administration and Anti‑Avoidance. The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations to prevent transactions intended to defeat these offsets, including rules for coordination with payroll, self‑employment, and pass‑through reporting.
How it works:
If updated scoring ever shows a deficit increase over the 5‑ or 10‑year window, the automatic high‑income contribution offsets switch on the next fiscal year until neutrality is restored.
Explanation:
Solvency and budget neutrality are maintained automatically, with no changes for households under $400,000.
Example:
If a later forecast shows a $12B 5‑year shortfall, the specified high‑income offsets activate until the gap is closed within 3 years.
Explanation:
Predictable and focused at the top-no new burden on working families.
Section 3. Strengthen the Contribution Base (High‑Income Focus)
Introduce targeted high‑income contributions while maintaining current law for households under $400,000.
Explanation:
Ensures those at the very top contribute a bit more to protect earned benefits for everyone.
Coordinate payroll and pass‑through reporting to reduce leakage and improve compliance.
Explanation:
Better data matching and enforcement keep the Trust Fund whole.
Section 4. Protect Earned Benefits &amp; COLA
No cuts to scheduled benefits; preserve annual cost‑of‑living adjustments.
Explanation:
Safeguards retirees and people with disabilities against inflation and benefit erosion.
Improve beneficiary services through modernized SSA staffing and technology.
Explanation:
Faster claims processing and better field office support.
Section 5. Anti‑Poverty Improvements
Establish a modernized minimum benefit for long‑term low‑wage workers.
Explanation:
Rewards years of work so no one who paid in retires into poverty.
Provide credited earnings for caregiving years within reasonable limits.
Explanation:
Recognizes unpaid caregiving that interrupts earnings histories.
Section 6. Trust Fund Integrity &amp; Transparency
Require plain‑language annual updates on solvency and contribution sufficiency.
Explanation:
Clear public reporting builds trust and accountability.
Strengthen antifraud analytics and cross‑checks while protecting privacy.
Explanation:
Focuses resources where they matter and reduces improper payments.
Section 7. Program Administration
Modernize SSA IT systems for secure, timely benefits and improved customer service.
Explanation:
Reduces backlogs and errors with modern infrastructure.
Enhance field office staffing in high‑need communities.
Explanation:
Shorter wait times, better access for seniors and people with disabilities.
Results &amp; ROI
Benefits Protected:
No cuts to earned benefits or COLA.
Trust Fund Stability:
High‑income contributions and compliance improvements keep the program strong.
Budget Neutrality:
Guardrail keeps both 5‑ and 10‑year windows at no net increase.
Working Families Protected:
No new taxes for households under $400,000.
Better Service:
Modernized SSA systems and staffing reduce delays and errors.
