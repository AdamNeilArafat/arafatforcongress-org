<p>“This <strong>Bill</strong> may be cited as the <em>Tax Fairness &amp; Relief Bill (2027)</em>.”</p>
<!-- Section 2 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 2. Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li>The wealthiest 1% and large corporations exploit loopholes to avoid taxes, while working families shoulder unfair burdens.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Many high‑profit firms pay lower effective tax rates than typical workers. This bill corrects that imbalance so regular families aren’t subsidizing the ultra‑wealthy.</span>
</li>
<li>No household earning under $400,000 shall face higher taxes under this <strong>Bill</strong>.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Guarantees working and middle‑class families won’t pay more. New revenue comes from closing loopholes at the top.</span>
</li>
<li>Revenues from this <strong>Bill</strong> will fund job creation, community investment, and deficit reduction.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Instead of giveaways to the top, new revenue strengthens local economies and reduces debt.</span>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- Section 2A -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 2A. Tax Fairness Guardrails</h2>
<p class="mb-3">To ensure this <strong>Bill</strong> delivers a fair outcome for workers and small business while protecting fiscal stability, the following guardrails shall apply and control in the event of conflict.</p>

<pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded"><code><strong>Rule Text.</strong>
(1) Effective Rate Fairness Test. In no taxable year shall the average effective federal tax rate of the top ten percent of households by income be lower than the average effective federal tax rate of the middle fifty percent of households. If the parity test is not met based on Joint Committee on Taxation and Treasury data, automatic adjustments shall apply in the next tax year to restore parity, including:
    (A) a surtax calibration on very high incomes,
    (B) phase‑out adjustments to high‑end preferences, and
    (C) a true‑up to the corporate book‑minimum computation.

(2) Protection for Households Under $400,000. Nothing in this Bill shall increase statutory rates or net tax liability for households with adjusted gross income under $400,000. Treasury shall implement administrative safeguards to prevent incidental increases, including conformity for withholding tables and credits.

(3) No Net Increase Fiscal Guardrail. The provisions of this Bill shall not produce a net increase in the unified federal deficit over the 5‑year and 10‑year budget windows as scored by CBO and JCT. If a shortfall is identified, automatic offsets shall take effect within 3 fiscal years, prioritized to:
    (A) close specified high‑end preferences,
    (B) increase the excise rate on large corporate stock repurchases, and
    (C) tighten the corporate minimum tax base.

(4) Scoring and Transparency. CBO and JCT shall publish an annual parity table showing average effective tax rates by decile and the status of the parity test, with public microdata documentation sufficient for replication. Treasury shall maintain a public dashboard on corporate effective tax rates under the book‑minimum.

(5) Anti‑Avoidance and Administration. The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations and other guidance to prevent avoidance transactions that would defeat the purpose of these guardrails, including rules aligned to GAAP financial statements for corporate book income and jurisdiction‑by‑jurisdiction computations for foreign income.</code></pre>

<ul class="mt-3">
  <li><strong>How it works:</strong> We check average effective rates each year. If top incomes fall below the middle, the automatic true‑ups restore parity the next year.<br/>
  <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Keeps the system fair without waiting for a new bill. Protects families under $400,000 and the overall budget.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the middle fifty percent averages 13% and the top ten percent averages 11%, the parity test fails. The surtax calibration and preference phase‑outs apply the next year until the top average is at least 13%.<br/>
  <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Simple yardstick. If the top pays a lower average rate than typical workers, guardrails auto‑correct.</span></li>
</ul>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 3. Corporate Minimum Tax on Book Profits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corporations with annual profits over $1 billion shall pay no less than a 15% tax on book income (profits reported to shareholders).<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ensures highly profitable firms contribute fairly, regardless of loopholes.</span>
</li>
<li>Prevents “zero‑tax” outcomes for profitable multinationals by limiting preferential adjustments that erase liability.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Levels the playing field so small businesses and workers aren’t carrying the load.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Section 4 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 4. Stop Offshoring &amp; Profit Shifting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Align U.S. taxation of foreign profits with OECD Pillar Two (15% global minimum), applied on a jurisdiction‑by‑jurisdiction basis.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ends the race to the bottom and discourages shifting profits to tax havens.</span>
</li>
<li>Strengthen rules so profits are taxed where economic activity occurs; curb the use of shell subsidiaries.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Encourages investment and jobs at home instead of paper profits abroad.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Section 5 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 5. Targeted Relief for Families &amp; Small Business</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expand the Child Tax Credit (refundable up to $3,600 per child) and strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit for low‑ and middle‑income workers.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Proven tools to reduce poverty and boost household income.</span>
</li>
<li>Simplify small‑business expensing up to $5 million annually.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Helps Main Street reinvest and grow without red tape.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Section 6 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 6. Tax Fairness Credit</h2>
<p>Replace select high‑end itemized deductions with a flat, capped credit available to all taxpayers.</p>
<p class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ends perks tilted toward the wealthy; delivers a simpler, fairer benefit for everyone.</p>
<!-- Section 7 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 7. Transparency &amp; Accountability</h2>
<ul>
<li>Require an annual public dashboard showing effective tax rates of large corporations.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Sunlight on corporate tax bills keeps the system honest.</span>
</li>
<li>Modernize e‑filing for universal adoption and faster processing.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cuts filing costs and reduces backlogs.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- Section 8 -->
<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 8. Enforcement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enhance IRS enforcement against high‑income evasion; no increase in audit rates for households under $400,000.<br/>
<span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Collects what’s owed at the top while protecting middle‑class filers.</span>
