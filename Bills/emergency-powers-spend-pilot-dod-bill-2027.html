<h2 class="section-title h4 mb-3">TITLE I — PURPOSE, SCOPE, DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose.</strong> Pilot an “approval-to-spend” rule at DoD during covered periods for actions initiated under NEA/10 U.S.C./50 U.S.C. emergency authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Covered period.</strong> Same definition used across the project (Minibus-1).</p>
<p><strong>Actions covered.</strong> New obligations, reprogramming, or contract awards first initiated in a covered period and predicated on emergency authority.</p>

<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">TITLE II — APPROVAL-TO-SPEND MECHANIC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>30-day temporary window:</strong> DoD may obligate funds for urgent actions for up to 30 days post-initiation with an agency-head life-safety/operational certification to Congress and OMB.</li>
<li><strong>Approval requirement:</strong> Beyond 30 days, continued obligation requires a joint Congressional approval or explicit appropriation/authorization line-item.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Force protection in active hostilities and statutory notifications already required under Title 10 remain unaffected but must carry an OMB Compliance ID for tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p class="explain"><strong>Project history context:</strong> This mirrors your “NDAA window” pilot to test the model before scaling government-wide in the Round-Two clean-up bill.</p>

<h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3" id="wpr-nea">War Powers &amp; National Emergencies Resolution Templates</h2>
<p class="mb-2">Pair this pilot with ready-to-file resolutions that force timely floor decisions on unauthorized hostilities or stale emergency declarations.</p>

<h3 class="h5 mb-2">When to use</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>WPR (War Powers Resolution):</strong> Use when U.S. forces are introduced into hostilities/armed conflict without authorization, or when the 60–90 day clock is expiring.</li>
  <li><strong>NEA (National Emergencies Act):</strong> Use to terminate or disapprove an emergency that predicates the spending you’re gating in this pilot.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h5 mb-2">Template — WPR Withdrawal Resolution</h3>
<pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded"><code><strong>Concurrent Resolution</strong>
Directing the President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)),

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that United States Armed Forces have been introduced into hostilities,
or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, without specific statutory authorization.
SECTION 2. REMOVAL. Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution, the President shall remove United States Armed Forces
from hostilities in or against &lt;Country/Entity&gt; not later than 30 days after the adoption of this resolution, except for forces
engaged solely in (A) protection of United States diplomatic personnel and facilities, or (B) the safe withdrawal of personnel.
SECTION 3. REPORTS. The President shall submit a report to Congress within 7 days and every 14 days thereafter describing actions taken to comply.</code></pre>

<h3 class="h5 mb-2">Template — NEA Termination/Disapproval</h3>
<pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded"><code><strong>Joint Resolution</strong>
Relating to the termination of the national emergency declared with respect to &lt;Subject&gt;.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 2. TERMINATION. Pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622),
the national emergency declared by the President on &lt;Date&gt; with respect to &lt;Subject&gt; is hereby terminated.
SECTION 3. EFFECT ON AUTHORITIES. Any authorities exercised solely by reason of that emergency shall cease upon enactment,
except as necessary to wind down obligations incurred lawfully prior to termination and to address an imminent threat to life for up to 7 days.</code></pre>
