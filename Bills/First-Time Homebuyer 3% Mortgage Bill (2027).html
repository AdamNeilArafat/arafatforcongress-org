Short Title
“This Bill may be cited as the First-Time Homebuyer 3% Mortgage Bill (2027).”
Section 2. Findings
First-time homeownership rates are at historic lows, with only 24% of recent home purchases made by first-time buyers.
Explanation:
Young Americans are being priced out. Without intervention, homeownership becomes a privilege of the wealthy, widening inequality.
Rising interest rates averaging above 6.5% and median home prices exceeding $425,000 nationally have made housing unaffordable for many.
Explanation:
Even middle-class households can’t qualify or afford payments. This locks out millions of would-be homeowners.
Homeownership is a primary means of wealth building for American families and strengthens communities.
Explanation:
Owning a home helps families build equity, stay rooted, and pass on generational wealth. Renters miss that opportunity.
A federally backed three percent mortgage will lower costs for first-time buyers while requiring safeguards to prevent housing inflation.
Explanation:
Lowering interest makes monthly payments affordable, but price caps and oversight prevent sellers from simply raising prices.
The program must be implemented in a fiscally responsible manner without raising taxes.
Explanation:
The program is designed to be budget-neutral, paid for with fees, reallocations, and existing funds-not new taxes.
Section 3. Definitions
First-time homebuyer means someone who hasn’t owned a primary residence in the past 3 years.
Explanation:
Prevents repeat buyers from gaming the system and ensures the benefit goes to true first-timers.
Eligible home means a primary residence (single-family, condo, co-op, or small multi-family where borrower lives in one unit).
Explanation:
Keeps focus on stable, owner-occupied housing rather than vacation homes or rentals.
Maximum Purchase Price Cap means the ceiling on home prices eligible for the program.
Explanation:
Stops subsidies from being used to buy luxury homes and keeps focus on starter homes.
Section 4. Establishment of Program
HUD shall establish the First-Time Homebuyer 3% Mortgage Program.
Explanation:
A clear federal framework ensures uniformity across lenders and regions.
Loans must: (1) carry a fixed 3% rate, (2) last no more than 30 years, (3) be used only for eligible homes, and (4) meet HUD underwriting standards.
Explanation:
Protects buyers from predatory terms, ensures affordability, and prevents program abuse.
Loans guaranteed by the federal government, backed by full faith and credit.
Explanation:
Gives lenders confidence to participate widely while shielding buyers from market rate shocks.
Borrowers must complete HUD-approved homebuyer counseling.
Explanation:
Reduces foreclosure risk by educating buyers about mortgages, budgeting, and responsibilities.
Section 5. Purchase Price Limits
Baseline cap equals national median home price.
Explanation:
Keeps the program tied to what’s affordable for an average buyer.
Adjusted caps: up to 150% of median in high-cost areas; not less than 80% in low-cost areas.
Explanation:
Allows access in expensive cities like San Francisco or New York without over-subsidizing luxury homes.
Caps updated annually by HUD.
Explanation:
Prevents the cap from becoming outdated as housing markets shift.
Section 6. Funding and Fiscal Responsibility
No new taxes.
Explanation:
Keeps the promise that working Americans won’t face higher costs.
Costs covered by: (1) borrower interest and guarantee fees, (2) reallocation of housing funds, (3) reduced subsidies for luxury/high-income borrowers.
Explanation:
Shifts resources from wealthy borrowers who don’t need subsidies to first-time buyers who do.
Federal Reserve, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac authorized to provide liquidity.
Explanation:
Ensures a healthy secondary market so lenders keep issuing 3% mortgages without drying up capital.
Program must remain budget-neutral. Fees adjusted as needed to offset costs.
Explanation:
Prevents this from becoming an endless drain on federal budgets.
Section 7. Oversight
HUD must monitor performance: loan volume, default rates, and housing price impacts.
Explanation:
Ensures program goals are met without fueling inflation.
HUD Inspector General audits annually; Government Accountability Office reports at 2 and 5 years.
Explanation:
Creates independent watchdogs to prevent waste or abuse.
Annual reports to Congress on utilization, fiscal impact, and market effects.
Explanation:
Keeps lawmakers and the public informed, allowing mid-course corrections.
Section 8. Sunset
Program authority ends after 10 years.
Explanation:
Forces Congress to re-evaluate, ensuring the program works before it becomes permanent.
Existing loans remain valid and federally backed.
Explanation:
Protects borrowers from sudden loss of support mid-mortgage.
Section 9. Effective Date
Takes effect 180 days after enactment.
Explanation:
Gives HUD time to set up infrastructure and rules before launch.
