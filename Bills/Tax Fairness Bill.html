      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mb-3">Section 1. Short Title</h2>
      <p>“This Act may be cited as the Tax Fairness & Relief Act of 2026.”</p>

      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 2. Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The wealthiest 1% and large corporations exploit loopholes to avoid taxes, while working families shoulder unfair burdens.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Many billionaires and big firms pay lower effective tax rates than nurses or truck drivers. This bill corrects that imbalance so regular families aren’t subsidizing the ultra-wealthy.</span>
        </li>
        <li>No household earning under $400,000 shall face higher taxes under this Act.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Guarantees that working and middle-class families won’t pay more. All new revenue comes from corporations and high earners exploiting loopholes.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Revenues from this Act will fund job creation, community investment, and deficit reduction.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Instead of giveaways to the top, new revenue will strengthen local economies, build infrastructure, and reduce debt.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 3. Corporate Minimum Tax on Book Profits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Corporations with annual profits over $1 billion shall pay no less than a 15% tax on book income (profits reported to shareholders).<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Some large firms report huge profits to Wall Street but pay $0 to the IRS. A 15% book minimum makes sure they contribute fairly, regardless of loopholes.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Ensures firms like Amazon and Netflix, which report profits but pay minimal federal tax, contribute fairly.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Levels the playing field so small businesses and workers aren’t carrying the load while mega-firms free ride.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 4 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 4. Stop Offshoring & Profit Shifting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Align U.S. taxation of foreign profits with OECD Pillar Two 15% global minimum.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ends the “race to the bottom” by making multinationals pay a fair minimum tax abroad and at home. Keeps jobs and investment in the U.S.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Strengthen Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) rules to tax profits where they’re earned, ending the use of shell subsidiaries.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Stops companies from parking profits in tax havens like Bermuda or the Caymans. Closes a major corporate loophole.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 5 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 5. Targeted Relief for Families & Small Business</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand the Child Tax Credit (refundable up to $3,600/child) and the Earned Income Tax Credit for low- and middle-income workers.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Proven tools to reduce poverty and boost household income. The 2021 CTC expansion cut child poverty nearly in half.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Simplify small-business expensing up to $5 million annually.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Makes it easier for small businesses to reinvest and grow without drowning in IRS paperwork. Helps Main Street, not Wall Street.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 6 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 6. Tax Fairness Credit</h2>
      <p>Replace high-end itemized deductions (e.g., mortgage interest on luxury homes, certain state/local write-offs) with a flat, capped credit available to all taxpayers.</p>
      <p class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ends tax perks tilted toward the wealthy. Everyone gets the same fair credit, middle-class filers benefit most.</p>

      <!-- Section 7 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 7. Transparency & Accountability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Require the IRS to publish an annual public dashboard showing effective tax rates of large corporations.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Sunlight on corporate tax bills keeps the system honest. Voters and investors can see who pays their share.</span>
        </li>
        <li>Modernize e-filing for universal adoption.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cuts filing costs and reduces IRS backlogs. Easier for small businesses and households.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 8 -->
      <h2 class="section-title h4 mt-5 mb-3">Section 8. Enforcement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhanced IRS enforcement authority against high-income evasion; no new audits for households under $400K.<br>
          <span class="explain"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The wealthy hide trillions through loopholes and offshore accounts. Strengthening enforcement collects what’s owed — but shields middle-class families from extra audits.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
