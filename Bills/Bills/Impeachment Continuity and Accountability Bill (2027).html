Continuity first:
stabilizes chain-of-command, acting service rules, and mission-essential operations during an impeachment period.
Implementation safeguards:
defines “funds” as money, supplies, staff time, IT, and facilities; requires written certifications and Government Accountability Office/inspector general review before implementing major actions.
Emergency spending approval:
for new emergency declarations during impeachment, requires a fast
approval‑to‑obligate
vote by Congress with narrow life‑safety carve‑outs.
Communications integrity:
tightens Federal Register/Government Publishing Office/Office of Management and Budget/Office of the Federal Register standards, record‑keeping, publication, and anti‑propaganda rules.
Real oversight:
Government Accountability Office audits, inspector general lanes, whistleblower shields, expedited court timelines,
daily civil penalties for subpoena defiance
, and
House civil litigation authority
to enforce compliance.
Why it matters
Impeachment is rare-but when it happens, the stakes are enormous. This bill keeps the lights on, prevents last‑minute abuses, and ensures the public record stays honest and intact while Congress does its job.
How it’s paid for
Deficit‑neutral:
primarily governance and oversight rules.
Targeted admin costs:
authorizes modest funds for dashboards, audits, and secure archiving; offset via FSGG administrative savings and anti‑waste recoveries.
Safeguards
Life‑safety carve‑outs only
for immediate protection and court‑ordered compliance.
Sunsets and reviews
for emergency approval mechanisms.
Severability
to preserve workable protections if any part is struck.

Frequently Asked Questions
Does this block disaster response?
No. Life‑safety, active disaster response, and court‑ordered compliance are carved out with short, renewable certifications.
Is this a power grab by Congress?
It’s a time‑limited balance: Congress confirms new emergency spending during impeachment while day‑to‑day government continues.
Does this freeze all regulations?
No. It pauses
major
actions without basic certifications and transparency; routine and safety‑critical actions continue.
What stops end‑runs through “acting” officials?
Serial acting appointments and structural reorganizations are restricted; Government Accountability Office and inspectors general can flag violations for rapid court review.
