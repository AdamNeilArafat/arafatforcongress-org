<h3 class="h5 mb-2 mt-4">Establishment of Daily Civil Penalty</h3>
<div class="template"><pre class="mb-0">Sec. 1. A person who, without adequate cause, fails to appear, testify, or produce papers as required by a subpoena issued by the House or any committee or subcommittee shall be liable to the House for a civil penalty of $5,000 for the first day of noncompliance and $10,000 for each day thereafter until compliance or lawful excuse is certified.
Sec. 2. No penalty shall accrue unless the chair certifies in writing that the subpoena was duly authorized and served, that a reasonable time to comply has elapsed, and that the witness was afforded notice and an opportunity to cure.</pre></div>

<h3 class="h5 mb-2 mt-4">Assessment and Collection</h3>
<div class="template"><pre class="mb-0">Sec. 3. The Clerk shall assess penalties upon receipt of the chair certification and shall provide written notice to the person.
