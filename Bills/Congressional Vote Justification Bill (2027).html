SHORT TITLE.
“This Bill may be cited as the Congressional Vote Justification Bill of 2027.”
Provides the bill’s official name for citation and recordkeeping.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Citizens have a right to know the reasons their elected representatives cast votes in favor of or against legislation.
Impact:
Establishes that the bill is rooted in democratic accountability and voter trust.
Transparency promotes accountability and strengthens public trust in government.
Impact:
Connects vote explanations directly to restoring legitimacy of Congress.
While many Members voluntarily issue vote explanations, no rule or statute currently requires such disclosure.
Impact:
Identifies the gap - voluntary practice is uneven, so law is needed.
Providing standardized, factual justifications for votes will improve legislative deliberation and allow constituents to evaluate their representation.
Impact:
Frames justifications as both a tool for voters and an internal check on sloppy or politically motivated votes.
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
“Covered vote” means a recorded vote in the House or Senate on final passage of a bill, joint resolution, or conference report.
Impact:
Keeps scope manageable - only major, final votes require justification.
“Justification statement” means a written explanation submitted by a Member under Section 4.
Impact:
Creates the key compliance document.
“Standard form” means the template adopted under Section 5.
Impact:
Ensures consistency and comparability across Members and parties.
SEC. 4. JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.
(a) Requirement.
Each Member casting a vote on a covered vote shall submit a justification statement.
Impact:
Makes justification mandatory, not optional.
(b) Content.
Each statement shall include:
A legal or constitutional basis.
Impact:
Forces Members to ground decisions in law, not just politics.
Ethical or moral considerations.
Impact:
Provides voters insight into values guiding the decision.
Utilitarian or policy analysis, including expected impacts.
Impact:
Adds forward-looking analysis: costs, benefits, tradeoffs.
Relevant factual evidence, metrics, or data.
Impact:
Makes reasoning verifiable, reducing pure rhetoric.
(c) Length.
Statements shall meet the minimum word count established by committee rule.
Impact:
Prevents perfunctory one-line answers; keeps flexibility to committees.
SEC. 5. STANDARD FORM.
(a) Development.
Within 90 days, the Speaker and Senate President shall adopt a standardized form.
Impact:
Ensures uniform structure, fast implementation.
(b) Format.
The form shall require responses under headings for legal basis, ethical rationale, policy/utilitarian impact, and factual evidence.
Impact:
Guarantees side-by-side comparability across Members’ explanations.
SEC. 6. TIMING AND PUBLICATION.
(a) Submission.
Members shall submit statements at the time of, or immediately after, casting a covered vote.
Impact:
Prevents retroactive spin; ensures contemporaneous reasoning.
(b) Publication.
Statements shall be:
Printed in the Congressional Record.
Published on official House/Senate websites.
Posted on each Member’s official site.
Impact:
Guarantees accessibility to public, media, watchdogs, and historians.
SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.
(a) Referral.
Failure to submit leads to referral to the Ethics Committee.
Impact:
Creates accountability mechanism without criminalizing noncompliance.
(b) Sanctions.
Chambers shall set sanctions, which may include censure, loss of privileges, or loss of committee assignments.
Impact:
Real consequences, but details left to rules committees to adapt.
(c) No Effect on Vote.
Failure to submit does not invalidate the Member’s vote.
Impact:
Preserves constitutional voting rights; enforcement is separate.
SEC. 8. RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.
This Bill is enacted pursuant to rulemaking authority of the House and Senate, and shall be considered part of the rules of each House.
Impact:
Avoids constitutional challenge - Congress controls its own procedures.
SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Bill takes effect January 1 of the first calendar year after enactment.
Impact:
Provides lead time for adoption and training.
SEC. 10. SINGLE-SUBJECT REQUIREMENT.
(a) Rule of Construction.
Each bill or joint resolution shall embrace only one subject, clearly stated in the title.
Impact:
Ends “Christmas tree” bills packed with unrelated riders.
(b) Point of Order.
Any Member may raise a point of order if a bill violates this section.
Impact:
Gives Members a tool to block logrolling or unrelated add-ons.
(c) Remedy.
If violation is found, the Presiding Officer returns the bill to committee for division into separate measures.
Impact:
Forces clean, focused legislation - makes back-room deals harder.
Results &amp; ROI
Restores Trust:
Radical transparency and contemporaneous explanations show voters who their representatives serve.
Improves Deliberation:
Members must ground votes in law, ethics, policy analysis, and facts.
Prevents Logrolling:
Single-subject rule reduces unrelated riders and back-room deals.
Accountability without Overreach:
Ethics referrals and sanctions create deterrence while preserving voting rights.
Administrative Costs Only:
Implemented via existing Congressional processes and publications.
